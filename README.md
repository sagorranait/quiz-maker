## Features of QuizMaker
 - For building the UI, I've used [React Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/). The most popular front-end framework Rebuilt for React.
 - For the Icons, I've used [Hero Icons](https://heroicons.com/).
 - I've used [React-toastify](https://fkhadra.github.io/react-toastify/introduction/), to show messages for the Correct answer, the Wrong answers, and also for the eye button to show the Right answer.
 - I've also used [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) in this project.
 - For the Correct, and Wrong answers chart in the Quiz route and also for the Quiz Analytics chart, I've used [Recharts](https://recharts.org/en-US/)
